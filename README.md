# wk1-homework Git: code Refactor

## Goal
The goal of this project was to refactor the html and css code to make it meet accessibility standards and to make sure the code is easy to follow semantically and make sure all links work.

## What I did
* Made the  the HTML body into a nav bar, header, 2 sections, and a footer
* Refactored HTML and CSS to make it meet accessibility standards by adding alts to all images and an aria-label for the background image in the header.
* Removed unnecessary ul and li in the nav bar
* Made sure links point to proper IDs
* Combined CSS into a higher level element where ever it was duplicated 
* reordered some things so they followed a similar structure in the CSS as the HTML
